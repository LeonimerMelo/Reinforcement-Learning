Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

Q-learning and others algorithms are a reinforcement learning algorithm that finds an optimal action-selection policy for any finite Markov decision process (MDP). It helps an agent learn to maximize the total reward over time through repeated interactions with the environment, even when the model of that environment is not known.
